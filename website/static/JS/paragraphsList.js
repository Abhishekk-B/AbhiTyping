    "Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.",
    "Oceans and lakes have much in common, but they are also quite different. Both are bodies of water, but oceans are very large bodies of salt water, while lakes are much smaller bodies of fresh water. Lakes are usually surrounded by land, while oceans are what surround continents. Both have plants and animals living in them. The ocean is home to the largest animals on the planet, whereas lakes support much smaller forms of life. When it is time for a vacation, both will make a great place to visit and enjoy.",
    "The school fair is right around the corner, and tickets have just gone on sale. Even though you may be busy, you will still want to reserve just one day out of an entire year to relax and have fun with us. Even if you don’t have much money, you don’t have to worry. A school fair is a community event, and therefore prices are kept low. Perhaps, you are still not convinced. Maybe you feel you are too old for fairs, or you just don’t like them. Well, that’s what my grandfather thought, but he came to last year’s school fair and had this to say about it: “I had the best time of my life!” While it’s true that you may be able to think of a reason not to come, I’m also sure that you can think of several reasons why you must come.  We look forward to seeing you at the school fair!",
    "The Dowry system is evil in society. It has reduced the sacred affair of marriage to a business deal. Brides are treated as a marketable commodity. The parents of the brides are often put under inhuman pressure for a handsome dowry. Sometimes they become paupers to get their daughters married. In many cases, young brides are ruthlessly tortured or pushed to suicide. To eradicate this social evil, a total change in the outlook of society is a must. The woman has to be considered as an equal partner to the man. Widespread education and employment and their rights of property can bring about the right remedy.",
    "An aim is a goal or objective to achieve in life. In order to succeed in life, one must have a goal. My aim in life is to be a teacher. Teaching is a noble and responsible profession. I have come to know that the ever-increasing misery and distress, are due to the ignorance and illiteracy of the people of our country. So I have decided to spread education among the masses as much as possible within my humble power. As a teacher, I shall try my best to impart man-making education. Some say that money is the honey of life. But I do not agree with them. Rather, I think that morality is the real honey of life. I want to be a lovable and respectable person as a teacher in the future.",
    "Human life is a mixture of weal and woe, smiles and tears. However, once what had seemed to be a memorable day turned out to be the saddest day of my life. We had planned for a picnic with all our classmates after the examination on the bank of the river Ganga. We started early in the morning and reached at 10 am. After the cooking was completed, we wished to take a bath in the Ganga. Our class teacher warned that only those who knew swimming would be allowed to bathe in the river. Rajesh, our youngest classmate, did not know how to swim.",
    "Early men did not know how to grow food and use fire. Now we are totally dependent on the gifts of Science. Science had made our life easier and enjoyable with vehicles, TV, radio, telephones, lights, media, computers, etc. Space flight is another wonder of science. Thus through the gifts of science, a man who had once lived in the cave has now landed on the moon. Yet there are some abuses of science. It has given us the frightful nuclear weapons that can destroy the whole world. But science cannot be blamed for this. We can use fire for cooking our food or burning other’s houses. It is not the fault of fire, but of its users. Likewise, man is responsible for the uses and abuses of science.",
    "In recent periods, many campaigns have been organized against employing children in mines, factories, motor garages, restaurants, tea stalls, and shops. There are various households that employ poor children though only a few provide their child-servants with adequate food and clothing. They are deprived of education and their wages are paid to their parents and the money is rarely spent on them. It is the extreme poverty of their parents that forces the children to adopt such a profession at a minor age.",
    "Family is the place where you learn your first lesson in life. Your family members are the only assets that will remain with you forever. Whatever the circumstances, family members are always there for each other to support us. Good values and good morals are always taught in a family. In the family, we are prepared to respect our elders and love younger ones. We learn lessons consistently from our family, about honesty, dependability, kindness and so on. Family always provides us with a sensation of so much love and care.",
    "The greatest wealth is our own health. A healthy body can earn great wealth but, a wealthy person cannot earn great health. We live in a fast-moving world where individuals have no time for themselves. Most part of their life withers away in search of materialistic wealth in order to outshine others but, along the way, they lose their health. Wealth matters, but, is not as important as health. Spending lots of money on junk food in five-star hotels or on other entertainment sources like watching films for a day and so on has no advantages other than self-satisfaction."
